Personal Website Project

This is my Personal Website project that will be used as a professional portfolio..
## PWP Feedback
### Milestone 1
#### Feedback: 
Amazing job on your PWP Milestone 1 submission. Your purpose, audience, and goals are well defined and meet the scope of the project. Your persona is well formed and seems like a real person. The user-story is simple and straight to the point. You also did a great job of defining the tech that your persona uses. I ran your site through https://validator.w3.org/ to check for errors in your HTML is error free. Finally, your directory structure and the .gitignore file was setup according to project specifications.
#### Grades: Tier IV


### Milestone 2a

Good work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and concise. One thing you might want to think about is the tone of your page and how it will speak to the visitors of your site. When I say this, think about your use of words and how you want them to flow through your content. Just something to note for your growth as a web dev. Nonetheless, everything you have here in your content strategy will help you in the development phase ahead.

For the portfolio section of your site I would suggest using an interactive gallery such as [FancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)

Additional recommendations:

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) will have all the documentation you need for generating a quick layout for your site.
[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
